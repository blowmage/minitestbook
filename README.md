Right now, I need to go through the painstaking process of merging copyeditor
changes into my asciidoc manuscript, and then setup the build toolchain again in
a way that's easy enough for contributors to access.

But for those who wish to fork and experiment on their own, all content here is

If you have any questions about legal usage, contact me, and I'll
talk with O'Reilly.
