Minitest::Spec DSL
==================

In chapter 1 we looked at the Minitest API and using Minitest::Test to create test classes and methods using assertion and helper methods. This style of testing may seem primitive to some who prefer using a high level spec DSL instead. Minitest also provides a spec DSL, but to understand the spec DSL you must first understand the Minitest API. So I encourage you to read chapter 1 if you skipped it in your excitement.
