Preface
=======

This book is written for Minitest 5.0 using Ruby 2.0. If you are using Ruby 1.9 or 2.0 you already have a version of Minitest that comes with Ruby, but it isn't 5.0. But getting the latest Minitest is very straightforward. First we need to use rubygems to install the latest minitest:

    $ gem install minitest
    Fetching: minitest-5.0.6.gem (100%)
    Successfully installed minitest-5.0.6
    1 gem installed
