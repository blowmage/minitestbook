For Reviewers:

Thank you for reading this very early version of The Minitest Book. I am looking for any and all feedback. I am particularly interested in whether or not the structure of the book works. Does it feel like a book? An online tutorial? A screencast transcript? Please let me know what you think works and what you think does not work.

Thanks!
